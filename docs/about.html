                <p>It's interesting how life unfolds in ways we never expect. My path to Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique began through my own healing journey, shaped by experiences that invited deep reflection, surrender, and transformation.</p>
                
                <p>I experienced PTSD following two formative events: my child's medical emergency and my own experience with tick-borne illnesses. Both shattered my sense of safety and left me wondering if I'd ever feel whole again. These experiences fundamentally changed how I related to myself and to healing. As I sought relief—not just from symptoms, but from the deep disconnection I felt—I was drawn to alternative healing modalities that showed me what true healing can be.</p>
                
                <p>My background might seem unexpected for someone doing this work. I earned a degree in biology and spent two decades in environmental conservation and fundraising. But looking back, I see how curiosity, service, and respect for living systems have always guided me. QHHT allowed me to bring these values together—bridging scientific inquiry with the innate wisdom of consciousness.</p>
                
                <p>I completed my QHHT certification in January 2025 through the official Dolores Cannon QHHT training program. My training included facilitating 25 full sessions, and each one taught me something new about this profound work. Since then, I've continued to witness deeply cathartic and illuminating sessions that inspire humility and gratitude. Watching clients access their own clarity, insight, and healing never gets old.</p>
                
                <p>Three simple principles guide my life and my work: Do no harm. Stay curious and seek joy. Love yourself and others.</p>
                
                <p>QHHT naturally embodies these principles. My role is to offer a safe, compassionate, and grounded space where curiosity is welcomed, self-trust is strengthened, and meaningful insight can arise.</p>
                
                <p>I would be honored to support you on your own journey of discovery and healing, and I look forward to facilitating your session.</p>
                

                <div class="card approach-card">
                    <h3>My Approach</h3>
                    <p>I facilitate QHHT sessions in a dedicated office space designed to feel calm, welcoming, and supportive. The building is shared with practitioners who offer complementary healing modalities, including massage therapy and acupuncture, creating a setting centered on wellness and care.

My space is intentionally inviting, cozy, and relaxing—the kind of space where you can exhale and let your shoulders drop. From the moment you arrive, my goal is to help you feel safe, comfortable, and at ease. We take as much time as you need—nothing is rushed. I communicate clearly, check in throughout the session, and respect your individual needs. You can expect a grounded, compassionate presence that holds space for whatever needs to unfold. You are always safe, always in control, and can pause or stop at any time. Nothing happens without your consent.</p>

            <div class="qhht-info-card">
                <h3>The Origins of QHHT</h3>
                
                <p>Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique (QHHT) was developed by Dolores Cannon over her 45-year career as a hypnotherapist. Through thousands of sessions, Dolores discovered something remarkable: when clients reached the Somnambulistic state—a deep level of hypnosis—they could access the part of themselves that holds all the answers.</p>
                
                <p>Dolores called this the "Subconscious," though many practitioners use the term "higher self." This is the part of you that holds all wisdom about your life and can provide healing, answers, and direction when you need it most.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; text-align: center;">How QHHT Works</h3>

            <div class="card-grid">
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Theta Brainwave State</h3>
                    <p>This is the same state you experience twice daily: just before waking and just before falling asleep. In QHHT sessions, you're guided into this natural state where you can access insights and wisdom normally hidden from your conscious mind—while remaining aware and able to speak.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Inner Exploration</h3>
                    <p>During a QHHT session, you may experience past lives, current-life memories, symbolic imagery, or simply receive knowing and insight. You don't need to believe in past lives for QHHT to work—your higher self shows you exactly what's most helpful for you. The form it takes is unique to you and always relevant to your current life.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The higher self</h3>
                    <p>Once in the Somnambulistic state, direct communication with your higher self becomes possible. Your higher self knows everything about you, your life purpose, and has the ability to provide instantaneous healing when appropriate.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Healing & Transformation</h3>
                    <p>The higher self has the ability to identify and explain the cause of any problem or disease, and can perform instantaneous healings when appropriate. Many physical, emotional, and spiritual issues can be resolved.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>What Makes QHHT Unique</h3>
                <p>Unlike other hypnosis techniques, QHHT facilitates direct contact with your higher self. Every session is unique—your higher self shows you exactly what you need to see. These are some of the kinds of benefits clients may experience:</p>
                <ul class="qhht-unique-list">
                    
                    <li>Understanding your life purpose and soul contracts—so you can live with intention</li>
                    
                    <li>Healing physical conditions at their energetic root—often where other approaches haven't worked</li>
                    
                    <li>Releasing limiting beliefs and emotional trauma—freeing you to move forward</li>
                    
                    <li>Gaining clarity on important life decisions—making choices with confidence</li>
                    
                    <li>Connecting with guides, loved ones, and higher wisdom—for ongoing support</li>
                    
                    <li>Exploring consciousness beyond the physical realm—expanding your perspective</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </div>
