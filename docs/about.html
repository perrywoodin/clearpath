                <p>It's interesting how life unfolds in ways we never expect. My path to Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique began through my own healing journey, shaped by experiences that invited deep reflection, surrender, and transformation.</p>
                
                <p>I experienced PTSD following two formative events: my child's medical emergency and my own experience with tick-borne illnesses, which deeply shaped my nervous system and sense of well-being. These experiences changed how I related to myself and to healing. As I sought relief and healing, I was drawn to alternative healing modalities that not only supported my recovery, but also deepened my understanding of healing beyond conventional frameworks.</p>
                
                <p>Before this chapter of my life, I earned a degree in biology and spent two decades working in environmental conservation and fundraising. Curiosity, service, and respect for living systems have always guided me. Discovering QHHT allowed me to bring these values together, bridging scientific inquiry with the innate wisdom of consciousness.</p>
                
                <p>I completed my QHHT certification in January 2025. As part of my training, I facilitated 25 full QHHT sessions, gaining extensive hands-on experience supporting clients through deep and meaningful explorations. Since certification, I have had the honor of facilitating deeply cathartic and illuminating sessions that continue to inspire humility and gratitude as clients access clarity, insight, and healing from within themselves.</p>
                
                <p>In life and in my work, I follow three simple credos: Do no harm. Be curious and seek joy. Love oneself and others.</p>
                
                <p>QHHT naturally embodies these principles. My role is to offer a safe, compassionate, and grounded space where curiosity is welcomed, self-trust is strengthened, and meaningful insight can arise.</p>
                
                <p>I would be honored to support you on your own journey of discovery and healing, and I look forward to facilitating your session.</p>

            <div class="qhht-info-card">
                <h3>The Origins of QHHT</h3>
                
                <p>Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique (QHHT) was developed by the late Dolores Cannon over her 45-year career as a hypnotherapist. Through her work with thousands of clients, Dolores discovered that by inducing clients into the Somnambulistic state—the deepest level of hypnosis—she could help them access the part of themselves that holds all the answers.</p>
                
                <p>Dolores called this the "Subconscious" or "Higher Self" (SC). This part of ourselves is connected to Source energy and has unlimited knowledge and an extraordinary ability to heal the physical body when appropriate.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; text-align: center;">How QHHT Works</h3>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Somnambulistic State</h3>
                    <p>This is the same state you experience twice daily: just before waking and just before falling asleep. In QHHT sessions, you're guided into this natural state where you can access deeper levels of consciousness while remaining aware and able to speak.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Past Life Regression</h3>
                    <p>During a QHHT session, clients often experience past lives that are relevant to their current life situations. These experiences provide profound insights and understanding about recurring patterns, relationships, and life challenges.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Higher Self</h3>
                    <p>Once in the Somnambulistic state, direct communication with your Higher Self becomes possible. Your Higher Self knows everything about you, your life purpose, and has the ability to provide instantaneous healing when appropriate.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Healing & Transformation</h3>
                    <p>The Higher Self has the ability to identify and explain the cause of any problem or disease, and can perform instantaneous healings when appropriate. Many physical, emotional, and spiritual issues can be resolved.</p>

                <h3>What Makes QHHT Unique</h3>
                <p>Unlike other hypnosis techniques, QHHT is designed to facilitate direct contact with your Higher Self. This makes it an incredibly powerful tool for:</p>

                    <li>Healing physical conditions at their energetic root</li>
