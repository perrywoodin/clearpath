  paragraphs:
    - "If you're new to quantum healing, you might be wondering: What exactly will happen in a session? How does it work? What can it help with? Is it safe? These are all great questions, and this page is designed to give you a clear, honest understanding of what quantum healing through QHHT actually looks like."
    - "Quantum healing refers to healing that occurs at the deepest levels of consciousness—beyond the physical body, beyond the conscious mind, at the level of your higher self. Through QHHT (Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique), I guide you into a deep state of relaxation where your higher self becomes accessible."
    - "What makes this 'quantum'? Your higher self exists outside of linear time, with access to your life history, future possibilities, and the energetic patterns that influence your current physical and emotional reality. When healing occurs at this level, the effects ripple out into all dimensions of your being—physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual."

  steps:
    - title: "Schedule & Prepare"
      description: "Book your session online and receive preparation instructions. You'll formulate questions for your higher self, plan for 4-6 hours, and prepare your mind and body (hydration, rest, open mindset)."
    - title: "Life History (1-2 hours)"
      description: "We begin by talking. I want to hear your life story, understand your health challenges, and learn what questions you're bringing. This builds trust and helps your higher self know what to show you."
    - title: "Induction & Journey (2-3 hours)"
      description: "Using gentle guided visualization, I help you relax into the theta brainwave state—the deepest level of hypnosis. Most people find it easy and deeply relaxing. Your higher self then guides you through relevant experiences (which may include past-life imagery) chosen specifically for your healing."
    - title: "higher self Dialogue (1 hour)"
      description: "Once you're in deep trance, I call forth your higher self and ask your prepared questions. Your higher self explains what you've seen, why you're experiencing certain challenges, and what you need to know."
    - title: "Body Scan & Quantum Healing"
      description: "Your higher self scans your body from head to toe and initiates healing. This is where the 'quantum' aspect becomes visible—conditions often shift or disappear in real time as energetic imprints are cleared."
    - title: "Integration (30 minutes)"
      description: "After returning to normal awareness, we discuss the experience. You receive a full recording to listen to repeatedly—each time you hear it, new insights emerge and healing continues."

# About Laura
about_laura:
  title: "Your Quantum Healing Guide"
  paragraphs:
    - "I'm Laura Welles, and I came to quantum healing through my own desperate search for answers. In 2020, I was struggling with PTSD and a complex tick-borne illness that conventional medicine couldn't solve. My first QHHT session revealed the energetic roots of both conditions and initiated healing that changed everything."
    - "That experience was so profound that I trained to become a QHHT practitioner myself. I wanted to offer this gift to others who, like me, had tried everything and were ready for something deeper."
    - "As a biologist with a background in neuroscience, I bridge the worlds of science and spirituality. I understand skepticism, and I also know from direct experience that consciousness-based healing is real. Whether you're a believer or a skeptic, I'll meet you where you are and guide you safely through this transformative process."

# FAQ
faq:
  title: "Common Questions About Quantum Healing"
  items:
    - question: "What conditions can quantum healing help with?"
      answer: "Quantum healing through QHHT has helped clients with chronic pain, autoimmune conditions, anxiety, depression, trauma, relationship issues, life purpose questions, and spiritual seeking. Because it addresses root causes rather than symptoms, the range of what can heal is vast."
    - question: "How is quantum healing different from energy healing (Reiki, etc.)?"
      answer: "Energy healing practitioners work on your energy field from the outside. Quantum healing accesses your own higher self—the source of your being—to initiate healing from within. You're not receiving energy from someone else; you're activating your own infinite healing capacity."
    - question: "What if nothing happens? What if I don't feel different?"
      answer: "The vast majority of clients have profound experiences. However, healing unfolds on its own timeline. Some people feel immediate shifts; others notice changes over days or weeks. Trust that your higher self gave you exactly what you needed, even if it's not what you expected."
    - question: "Is quantum healing scientifically proven?"
      answer: "While QHHT specifically hasn't been studied in clinical trials, hypnosis as a healing modality has significant scientific support. The 'quantum' aspect relates to consciousness research showing that mind and matter are fundamentally interconnected. Your belief isn't required—your higher self knows how to heal you."
    - question: "How should I prepare for my first session?"
      answer: "Come well-rested and hydrated. Avoid alcohol for 24 hours before. Prepare a list of questions for your higher self (health, relationships, life purpose, etc.). Wear comfortable clothes. Most importantly, come with an open mind and trust in your own inner wisdom."
    - question: "What happens after the session?"
      answer: "You'll receive a full audio recording. Listen to it multiple times—healing continues with each listening. Drink plenty of water, rest if needed, and journal about insights as they emerge. Many clients experience additional shifts and 'aha moments' in the weeks following."
