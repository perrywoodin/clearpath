  origins:
    title: The Origins of QHHT
    paragraphs:
      - "Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique (QHHT) was developed by the late Dolores Cannon over her 45-year career as a hypnotherapist. Through her work with thousands of clients, Dolores discovered that by inducing clients into the Somnambulistic state—the deepest level of hypnosis—she could help them access the part of themselves that holds all the answers."

      - "Dolores called this the \"Subconscious\" or \"Higher Self\" (SC). This part of ourselves is connected to Source energy and has unlimited knowledge and an extraordinary ability to heal the physical body when appropriate."

    cards:
      - title: The Somnambulistic State
        description: "This is the same state you experience twice daily: just before waking and just before falling asleep. In QHHT sessions, you're guided into this natural state where you can access deeper levels of consciousness while remaining aware and able to speak."

      - title: Past Life Regression
        description: "During a QHHT session, clients often experience past lives that are relevant to their current life situations. These experiences provide profound insights and understanding about recurring patterns, relationships, and life challenges."

      - title: The Higher Self
        description: "Once in the Somnambulistic state, direct communication with your Higher Self becomes possible. Your Higher Self knows everything about you, your life purpose, and has the ability to provide instantaneous healing when appropriate."

      - title: Healing & Transformation
        description: "The Higher Self has the ability to identify and explain the cause of any problem or disease, and can perform instantaneous healings when appropriate. Many physical, emotional, and spiritual issues can be resolved."
