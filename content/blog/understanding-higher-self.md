One of the most profound aspects of QHHT is the direct communication with your higher self. But what exactly is the higher self, and how does this connection facilitate healing? Let's explore this fascinating dimension of consciousness.

## What Is the Higher Self?

The higher self—also known as the Subconscious, Oversoul, or SC—is the part of you that exists beyond your everyday conscious awareness. It's the eternal, all-knowing aspect of your being that has been with you through every lifetime and experience.

Think of your conscious mind as the tip of an iceberg. It's what you're aware of day-to-day: your thoughts, decisions, and immediate experiences. But beneath the surface lies a vast expanse of wisdom, memory, and understanding—this is your higher self.

## The Higher Self Knows Everything About You

During a QHHT session, when we establish communication with your higher self, something remarkable happens. This part of you has access to:

- Every experience from your current life
- Memories and lessons from your life journey (sometimes experienced as past-life imagery)
- The reasons behind your life circumstances
- The root causes of physical and emotional challenges
- Your life purpose and soul contracts
- Guidance for your path forward

> "The higher self loves you unconditionally and only wants what's best for your growth and evolution."

## How Healing Happens

One of the most extraordinary aspects of connecting with the higher self is its ability to facilitate healing. This isn't like conventional medicine—it works on an energetic and spiritual level.

When healing occurs during a QHHT session, the higher self may:

- Identify the root cause of a condition (often emotional or from earlier life experiences; sometimes experienced as past-life imagery)
- Clear blocked energy or trauma
- Perform what Dolores Cannon called "instantaneous healing"
- Provide understanding that itself brings relief
- Explain why certain conditions exist and what lessons they carry

It's important to understand that the higher self only heals when it's appropriate for your soul's journey. Sometimes a condition serves a purpose that needs to be understood first. The higher self always acts in your highest good.

## Why Does the Higher Self Help?

Your higher self isn't separate from you—it IS you, just a larger, wiser aspect that isn't limited by physical form or linear time. It wants you to thrive, to understand, to grow, and to remember who you truly are.

The connection during QHHT isn't creating something new. It's remembering and reconnecting with something that's always been there. Many clients describe the experience as "coming home" to themselves.

## Preparing to Connect

While the higher self is always accessible, certain conditions help facilitate a clearer connection:

- **Trust and openness** - Approach the session without rigid expectations
- **Clear intentions** - Know what questions you want answered
- **Relaxation** - A calm mind and body allow deeper access
- **Willingness** - Be open to whatever experiences or insights come

## After the Connection

Many clients find that their connection with their higher self doesn't end when the session does. Having once established clear communication, they find it easier to access that wisdom in daily life through meditation, dreams, or intuitive knowing.

The recording of your session becomes a powerful tool—each time you listen, you may notice new insights and continued healing effects.

## Final Thoughts

The higher self connection is perhaps the most transformative aspect of QHHT. It reminds us that we are so much more than our physical bodies and daily concerns. We are eternal beings with access to infinite wisdom and unconditional love.

If you're curious about connecting with your higher self, trust that curiosity. It may well be your higher self already guiding you toward this experience.
