# Introduction
intro:
  title: "QHHT Hypnotherapy in Albany, NY"
  paragraphs:
    - "If you're searching for hypnotherapy in Albany, you've likely tried conventional approaches and are looking for something deeper. QHHT (Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique) offers a fundamentally different experience than traditional hypnotherapy—one that addresses not just symptoms, but the root causes of your challenges."
    - "While traditional hypnotherapy works at lighter levels of consciousness for behavior modification (quitting smoking, weight loss, confidence building), QHHT guides you into the theta brainwave state—a deep level of hypnosis where profound healing, spiritual exploration, and lasting transformation occur."
    - "As a certified QHHT practitioner in Albany, I help clients access their higher self, explore meaningful inner material (sometimes past-life imagery), heal trauma at its source, and receive answers to life's biggest questions. This isn't about suggestion or behavior change—it's about discovering your inner wisdom and allowing healing to emerge from within."

    - "I'm Laura Welles, a certified QHHT practitioner and biologist based in Albany, NY. My journey to hypnotherapy began when I was navigating PTSD and complex health issues that conventional therapy couldn't fully address."
    - "My first QHHT session was unlike anything I'd experienced—not a therapist telling me what to think, but my own higher self showing me exactly what I needed to understand and heal. That profound experience led me to train in this modality so I could offer it to others."
    - "With a background in neuroscience and biology, I understand both the science of altered states and the spiritual dimensions of consciousness. Whether you're new to hypnotherapy or experienced with alternative healing, I create a safe, professional space for your journey."

# FAQ
faq:
  title: "Hypnotherapy Questions"
  items:
    - question: "Can anyone be hypnotized?"
      answer: "Yes. Hypnosis is a natural state you enter twice daily (falling asleep and waking up). Everyone can access it. The key is willingness, trust, and letting go of trying to control the process. I'm trained to work with all types of people, including analytical thinkers and skeptics."
    - question: "Will I be unconscious or lose control?"
      answer: "No. You remain aware and in control throughout. Hypnosis is not unconsciousness—it's an altered state where you're deeply relaxed but fully present. You can speak, answer questions, and return to normal awareness whenever you choose."
    - question: "What's the difference between QHHT and seeing a traditional hypnotherapist?"
      answer: "Traditional hypnotherapy uses suggestion at lighter levels to change habits or behaviors (smoking, anxiety, confidence). QHHT goes much deeper—accessing your higher self for spiritual exploration and root-cause healing, which may include past-life imagery. It's transformational rather than behavioral."
    - question: "How long do the results last?"
      answer: "Because QHHT addresses root causes rather than symptoms, the shifts tend to be lasting. Many clients experience permanent healing of physical conditions, release of lifelong patterns, and clarity that continues to unfold long after the session."
    - question: "What should I look for in a hypnotherapist?"
      answer: "Look for proper training and certification (QHHT practitioners train through the Quantum Healing Hypnosis Academy), experience with the specific issues you're facing, and someone who creates a safe, non-judgmental space. Trust your intuition—the right practitioner will feel right."
    - question: "Do you offer virtual hypnotherapy sessions?"
      answer: "QHHT sessions are in-person only at my Albany location. The depth of work we do requires the safety and focus of a dedicated physical space. Virtual sessions cannot access the same level of trance or provide the full healing experience."
