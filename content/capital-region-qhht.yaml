# Introduction
intro:
  title: "QHHT Sessions for Capital Region Residents"
  paragraphs:
    - "Looking for QHHT in the Capital Region? You've found the right place. Clear Path is the Capital Region's certified QHHT practitioner, offering professional quantum healing sessions at our Albany location—conveniently accessible from Saratoga Springs, Troy, Schenectady, and surrounding communities."
    - "QHHT (Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique) is a specialized healing modality that requires extensive training and certification. Unlike traditional hypnotherapy or life coaching, QHHT accesses the deepest level of consciousness to facilitate direct communication with your higher self, deep inner exploration (which may include past-life imagery), and profound physical and emotional healing."
    - "While the drive to Albany might seem inconvenient at first, most clients say the session is so transformative that they'd travel much farther. This is not a quick therapy appointment—it's a 4-6 hour journey into the depths of your consciousness that can shift your entire life trajectory."

# FAQ
faq:
  title: "FAQs for Capital Region Clients"
  items:
    - question: "Is it really worth traveling to Albany for QHHT?"
      answer: "Yes. QHHT is not a modality you can find everywhere—it requires extensive training and certification. Most clients say the session is the most transformative experience they've ever had, worth traveling much farther. The 20-50 minute drive is a small investment for potentially life-changing healing."
    - question: "Can I do a QHHT session virtually instead of driving to Albany?"
      answer: "No. QHHT requires a deep level of hypnosis (theta brainwave state), which is only reliably achievable in person. The safety, comfort, and energetic container of a physical healing space is essential for the depth of work we do."
    - question: "Should I plan to stay overnight in Albany?"
      answer: "Not necessary unless you're coming from 90+ minutes away. Most Capital Region clients drive home the same day. You'll feel peaceful and clear after the session—totally safe to drive. Some clients enjoy staying for dinner in Albany to extend the integration time."
    - question: "How far in advance should I book?"
      answer: "Book 2-4 weeks in advance for best availability. Sessions are offered on select days, and spaces fill up. If you have urgent needs or limited availability, reach out—sometimes there are last-minute openings."
    - question: "What if I need to reschedule?"
      answer: "Life happens. Please provide at least 72 hours notice if you need to reschedule. This allows time to offer your spot to another client. Last-minute cancellations may forfeit your deposit."
    - question: "Are there hotels near your office if I want to make a weekend of it?"
      answer: "Yes! The Hampton Inn Albany is 5 minutes away. The Morgan State House (boutique hotel) is a 10-minute walk. Downtown Albany hotels are 10-15 minutes. Combining your session with a weekend in Albany can be a beautiful self-care retreat."
