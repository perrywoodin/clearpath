# Note for future
future_note:
  title: "Building Our Testimonials"
  paragraphs:
    - "As a growing practice, I'm currently building this collection of client experiences. Each person who completes a QHHT session is invited to share their feedback if they feel called to do so."
    - "I never pressure clients to provide testimonials. The depth and personal nature of this work means some prefer to keep their experiences private, and that's completely respected."
    - "If you've had a session with me and would like to share your experience to help others, please reach out. Your story could be exactly what someone else needs to hear to take the first step on their healing journey."
