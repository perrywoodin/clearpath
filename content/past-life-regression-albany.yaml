# FAQ
faq:
  title: "Past Life Regression FAQs"
  items:
    - question: "Will I actually remember past lives or is it just imagination?"
      answer: "Not everyone experiences past-life imagery, and that's completely normal. If it does arise, it can feel vivid and detailed. Whether you interpret it as literal memory or symbolic story, the insights can be meaningful."
    - question: "What if I don't see anything or can't be hypnotized?"
      answer: "Everyone can access the theta brainwave state—you do it twice a day naturally. Some people are visual, others feel sensations or just 'know' information. I'm trained to work with all types of perception. The key is trust and letting go of trying to control the experience."
    - question: "Can past life regression heal physical conditions?"
      answer: "Healing is possible, but outcomes vary. Many clients experience relief from chronic pain, illness, or emotional patterns when their higher self reveals the source and releases the energetic imprint—whether or not that source is connected to past-life imagery."
    - question: "How many past lives will I see in one session?"
      answer: "It varies, and some sessions include no past-life imagery at all. Your higher self decides what will be most healing and relevant to your questions."
    - question: "What should I do to prepare for past life regression?"
      answer: "Come well-rested, hydrated, and with an open mind. Avoid alcohol for 24 hours before. Prepare a list of questions about your current life that you want your higher self to answer. I'll send detailed preparation instructions when you book."
    - question: "Is past life regression safe?"
      answer: "Yes, completely safe. You remain in control and can return to normal awareness at any time. As a certified practitioner, I'm trained to guide you through any challenging content (deaths, trauma) with care and ensure you feel grounded and integrated afterward."
