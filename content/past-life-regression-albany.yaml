# FAQ
faq:
  title: "Past Life Regression FAQs"
  items:
    - question: "Will I actually remember past lives or is it just imagination?"
      answer: "QHHT accesses the Somnambulistic state where past life memories are vivid and detailed. Whether you interpret them as literal memories or symbolic stories, the healing and insights are real. Most clients are surprised by the clarity and detail they experience."
    - question: "What if I don't see anything or can't be hypnotized?"
      answer: "Everyone can access the Somnambulistic state—you do it twice a day naturally. Some people are visual, others feel sensations or just 'know' information. I'm trained to work with all types of perception. The key is trust and letting go of trying to control the experience."
    - question: "Can past life regression heal physical conditions?"
      answer: "Yes. Many clients experience spontaneous healing of chronic pain, illness, and conditions that originated in past life trauma. When your Higher Self reveals the source and releases the energetic imprint, physical healing often follows."
    - question: "How many past lives will I see in one session?"
      answer: "It varies. Some clients explore 2-3 lives in detail, while others focus deeply on one significant lifetime. Your Higher Self decides based on what will be most healing and relevant to your questions."
    - question: "What should I do to prepare for past life regression?"
      answer: "Come well-rested, hydrated, and with an open mind. Avoid alcohol for 24 hours before. Prepare a list of questions about your current life that you want your Higher Self to answer. I'll send detailed preparation instructions when you book."
    - question: "Is past life regression safe?"
      answer: "Yes, completely safe. You remain in control and can return to normal awareness at any time. As a certified practitioner, I'm trained to guide you through any challenging content (deaths, trauma) with care and ensure you feel grounded and integrated afterward."
