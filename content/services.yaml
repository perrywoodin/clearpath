# --- FAQ SECTION ---
faq:
  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  questions:
    - q: "How long is a QHHT session?"
      a: "Most sessions take 4-6 hours. This includes the initial interview (60-90 min), the hypnosis portion (2-3 hours), and closing discussion (15-30 min). I never rush—each session unfolds at its own perfect pace."

    - q: "What's included in the session price?"
      a: "Your session includes the full QHHT experience, a complete audio recording of your session, and 7 days of follow-up email support. You'll be able to listen to your session recording as many times as you wish for continued integration."

    - q: "Do you offer payment plans?"
      a: "Yes, I understand that investing in your healing is a significant decision. Payment plans can be arranged—please mention this when you contact me and we'll find an option that works for you."

    - q: "What's your cancellation policy?"
      a: "Life happens, and I understand. Full refund if you need to cancel 7+ days before your session. 50% refund for 3-6 days notice. Unfortunately, I cannot offer refunds for cancellations within 48 hours, as I've reserved that entire day exclusively for you."

    - q: "How do I prepare for my session?"
      a: "Once you book, I'll send you a detailed preparation guide. The main things are: create a list of questions for your Higher Self, avoid caffeine the day of your session, wear comfortable clothing, and come with an open heart and curious mind."

    - q: "What if I've never been hypnotized before?"
      a: "Most of my clients haven't! QHHT hypnosis is gentle and natural—it's the same state you experience twice daily, just before falling asleep and just before waking up. Everyone can reach this state, and I'll guide you every step of the way."
