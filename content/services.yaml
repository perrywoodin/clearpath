# --- FAQ SECTION ---
faq:
  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  questions:
    - q: "How long is a QHHT session?"
      a: "Most sessions take 4-6 hours, but occasionally they can run longer—up to 10 hours in rare cases. This includes the initial conversation (1+ hours, often ~2), the hypnosis portion (typically 2-3 hours), and closing discussion (15-30 min). Sessions take as long as they take, so please plan for a full day of self-care and avoid scheduling anything afterward."

    - q: "What's included in the session price?"
      a: "Your session includes the full QHHT experience, a complete audio recording of your session, and 7 days of follow-up email support. You'll be able to listen to your session recording as many times as you wish for continued integration."

    - q: "Do you offer payment plans?"
      a: "Yes, I understand that investing in your healing is a significant decision. Payment plans can be arranged—please mention this when you contact me and we'll find an option that works for you."

    - q: "What's your cancellation policy?"
      a: "I understand that circumstances change. You'll receive a full refund if you cancel 7+ days before your session, or 50% refund with 3-6 days notice. Cancellations within 24 hours cannot be refunded, as I've reserved that entire day exclusively for you."

    - q: "How do I prepare for my session?"
      a: "Once you book, I'll send you a detailed preparation guide. The main things are: create a list of questions for your higher self. There’s no required number, but if you keep it to 20 or fewer, we can almost always cover them all. Try to avoid caffeine the day of your session. Wear comfortable clothing, and come with an open heart and curious mind. Please do not wear perfume, cologne, or strong scents due to sensitivities."

    - q: "What if I've never been hypnotized before?"
      a: "Most of my clients haven't! QHHT hypnosis is gentle and natural—it's the same state you experience twice daily, just before falling asleep and just before waking up. Most people find it easy and relaxing, and I'll guide you every step of the way."

    - q: "What if nothing happens during my session?"
      a: "This is a common concern, but in my experience, something always comes through. Your higher self always has information to share—though it may not always look the way you expect. Sometimes it's vivid imagery, sometimes it's subtle knowings, and sometimes it's deep emotional release. Trust that whatever comes is exactly what you need."
