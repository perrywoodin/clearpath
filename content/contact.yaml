  section_title: Frequently Asked Questions
  items:
    - question: How long is a QHHT session?
      answer: Sessions typically last 4-6 hours. This includes the interview, the hypnosis journey, and time for integration afterward. Please plan for a full day.

    - question: What's the investment?
      answer: "QHHT sessions are $350, which includes the full 4-6 hour experience, your session recording, and 7 days of follow-up support. Follow-up integration sessions are $100 for 60 minutes. I also offer a free 20-minute discovery call if you'd like to learn more before booking. Visit the Services page for complete details."

    - question: Do you offer virtual sessions?
      answer: "QHHT sessions are conducted in-person at my Albany location. The in-person format is essential for creating the safe, comfortable environment needed to reach the deep Somnambulistic state. This allows me to guide you more effectively and provide the full healing experience."

    - question: How do I prepare for a session?
      answer: Once your session is booked, I'll provide you with detailed preparation instructions, including how to formulate your questions and what to expect on the day of your session.
