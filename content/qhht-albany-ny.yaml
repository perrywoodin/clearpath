# FAQ
faq:
  title: "Common Questions About QHHT in Albany"
  items:
    - question: "How is QHHT different from traditional hypnotherapy?"
      answer: "QHHT guides you into the theta brainwave state—the deepest level of hypnosis where you access your higher self and deeper inner experiences (which may include past-life imagery). Traditional hypnotherapy typically works at lighter levels for behavior change. QHHT is designed for spiritual exploration and profound healing, not just symptom relief."
    - question: "Do I need to believe in past lives for QHHT to work?"
      answer: "No. Many clients start as skeptics, and not every session includes past-life imagery. Whether you interpret the experiences as literal past lives, metaphor, or imagination, the healing and insights that emerge can be real and transformative. Your higher self will show you exactly what you need to see."
    - question: "What can QHHT help with?"
      answer: "QHHT can address physical ailments, chronic pain, anxiety, depression, relationship patterns, life purpose questions, and spiritual seeking. Clients often experience spontaneous healing of conditions that haven't responded to conventional treatment."
    - question: "Is QHHT safe?"
      answer: "Yes, QHHT is completely safe. You remain in control throughout and can return to normal awareness at any time. As a certified practitioner, I'm trained to create a safe container for your journey and navigate any challenges that arise."
    - question: "How do I prepare for a QHHT session in Albany?"
      answer: "Once you book, I'll send detailed preparation instructions including how to formulate your questions, what to eat (or not eat) before the session, and what to bring. The most important preparation is intention setting and an open mind."
    - question: "Do you offer virtual QHHT sessions?"
      answer: "QHHT sessions are conducted in-person only at my Albany location. The in-person format is essential for reaching the deep theta brainwave state and providing the full healing experience. Virtual sessions don't allow for the same depth."
