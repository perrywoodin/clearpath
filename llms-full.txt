# Clear Path QHHT - Complete Reference

> Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique (QHHT) sessions in Albany, NY. Founded by certified practitioner Laura Welles, Clear Path guides clients into theta brainwave states to access their higher self for deep healing, spiritual growth, and self-discovery. Sessions address physical healing, life purpose clarity, emotional release, and inner exploration.

## Overview

Clear Path is a QHHT (Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique) practice located at 560 Delaware Ave, Albany, NY 12209, in the Center Square neighborhood. The practice is housed in a shared wellness building alongside complementary practitioners including massage therapists and acupuncturists.

QHHT is a therapeutic hypnosis technique developed by Dolores Cannon over 45+ years of research and practice. The methodology facilitates access to the higher self through guided relaxation into theta brainwave states—the natural brain state experienced just before sleep and upon waking. During sessions, clients remain conscious and in control while accessing deeper levels of awareness for healing, insight, and spiritual growth.

The practice serves individuals seeking alternative wellness approaches for issues where conventional methods have not provided satisfactory answers. Skepticism is welcome, as the practice emphasizes that "your experience will speak for itself."

## About Laura Welles

Laura Welles is a Certified QHHT Practitioner who completed the official Dolores Cannon QHHT training program in January 2025, including facilitating 25 full supervised sessions during certification.

**Background:** Laura holds a bachelor's degree in Biology and spent two decades working in environmental conservation and fundraising. Her scientific training informs her approach to consciousness exploration, bridging "scientific inquiry with the innate wisdom of consciousness."

**Personal Journey:** Laura's path to QHHT began through her own healing journey. Following her child's medical emergency and her own experience with tick-borne illnesses, she developed PTSD. Her personal healing experience with consciousness-based modalities led her to pursue QHHT training to offer this work to others.

**Guiding Principles:** Laura operates from three core values:
1. Do no harm
2. Stay curious and seek joy
3. Love yourself and others

**Session Approach:** Laura creates a calm, welcoming environment designed for client safety and comfort. Sessions are unhurried, with clear communication throughout. She emphasizes that "You are always safe, always in control, and can pause or stop at any time."

## Session Preparation & Expectations

### Before Your Session

- **Compile Questions:** Write out all questions you want to ask your higher self. There is no limit—topics can range from health and relationships to life purpose and spiritual questions.
- **Time Commitment:** Block your entire day; sessions typically run 4-6 hours, and you'll want quiet time afterward for integration.
- **Physical Preparation:** Minimize or avoid caffeine before your session; wear comfortable clothing.
- **Mental Preparation:** Approach with openness and trust in the process. Skepticism is normal and welcome—the experience itself will provide its own validation.

### During Your Session

You will remain fully conscious and in control throughout the entire experience. The theta brainwave state feels similar to deep relaxation or meditation. Most people report being aware of everything happening while simultaneously experiencing deeper levels of consciousness.

What emerges during the hypnosis portion varies by individual and what is most relevant to your questions:
- Some experience vivid past life imagery
- Others receive symbolic scenes or metaphorical experiences
- Some experience direct knowing or intuitive downloads
- Physical sensations, emotional releases, and spontaneous healing can occur

Your higher self determines what experiences will be most beneficial for your healing and growth.

### After Your Session

You will receive a complete audio recording of your session. Many clients find that listening to the recording reveals additional insights and layers they didn't fully register during the live experience. The recording becomes a valuable tool for ongoing integration.

Sessions often catalyze shifts that continue unfolding in the days, weeks, and months following the experience. The 7 days of email support provides space to process questions or experiences that arise during initial integration.
